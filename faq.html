    <dt><a href="">Why build a custom site, when I could use Squarespace or WordPress?</a></dt>
    <dd>Great question! You can use those platforms and make some pretty ok sites. Are you super familiar with those platforms already? If not, you will be spending a lot of time trying to customize a generic template into something unique and will most likely end up feeling kind of frustrated by the limitations a template can offer. I am happy to work in one of those platforms for you if you are really set on using one of them, or even happier to just create something brand spanking new just for you! </dd>

    <dt><a href="">What services do you offer?</a></dt>
    <dd>I offer clients work in HTML, CSS, Java, & Jekyll. I am happy to build the framework of your site or custom build the entire thing from frame to design. It all really depends on your site, but in general you provide all the needed photos and copy and I do most of the other magic. </dd>

    <dt><a href="">How long does a custom site take to build?</a></dt>
    <dd>Depends on the project, no surprise there I am sure.  Smaller one page sites take about a week whereas larger multiple page sites can take up to a month or more. This also depends on my workload so contacting me to check in on availability is the best idea.</dd>

    <dt><a href="">How much might it cost?</a></dt>
    <dd>Again this really depends on what kind of site you are looking for, but overall I bet you would be surprised to find out how affordable a custom site can be! A small one page design is always going to be your most affordable option whereas a multi-page website tends to cost a bit more. No matter the cost all of this is discussed upfront and before any contracts are signed so you will always be aware of the project budget from beginning to end. </dd>
